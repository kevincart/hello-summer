      <p>
        I am learning JavaScript, HTML, CSS and Node.JS.

      <p>
        I am currently studying towards a Masters of Fine Arts at Massey University, focusing on digital media, photography and videography. I have many years of experience working professionally in video production, and I have always been interested in technology. I have immensely enjoyed learning and working with JavaScript, Node.js, HTML, and CSS and would like to continue building my skills in a professional environment.

        Through Summer of Tech, I hope to intern and eventually become a full-time junior developer in Wellington. A position in technology would offer me the opportunity to learn from others in a supportive team, and help me utilise my creativity and learn new technologies.

        My coding knowledge has so far been self-taught with guidance from experienced developers. I learned JavaScript from the book 'Beginning JavaScript: Fifth Edition' by Jeremy McPeak and Paul Wilton. I have completed the following courses on Lynda.com 'HTML Essential Training,' 'CSS: Core Concepts,' 'Up and Running with Git and Github,' and 'Node.js Essential Training.' I also attended this year's nz.js(con); which inspired me to apply for Summer of Tech and join the Wellington.js Meetup.

        In addition, I am currently studying:
        •  'Object-Oriented JavaScript' by Ved Antani and Stoyan Stefanov;
        •  'Node.js Web Development: Third Edition' by David Herron;
        •  'Understanding ECMAScript 6' by Nicholas C. Zakas.
